Project Title & Short Description
CliniScan is an AI-powered system that automatically detects and localizes lung abnormalities from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The system aims to assist radiologists and healthcare providers by identifying key pathological findings like opacities, fibrosis, and masses, helping to streamline the diagnostic process.

‚ú® Key Features
ü©∫ Automated Abnormality Detection: Automatically identifies and localizes common lung abnormalities.

üñºÔ∏è Bounding Box Localization: Draws precise bounding boxes around detected findings for easy visualization.

üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Web Interface: A simple and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for easy image upload and analysis.

üöÄ Trained on a Large-Scale Dataset: The model is trained on the extensive VinDr-CXR dataset, containing 18,000 annotated images.
