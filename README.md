# CliniScan: AI Lung Abnormality Detection
<!--CliniScan is an AI-powered system that automatically detects and localizes lung abnormalities from chest X-ray images. The script uses a deep learning model trained on the VinDr-CXR dataset to identify findings like opacities and fibrosis, aiming to assist radiologists in their diagnostic workflow. -->

### Prerequisites
<!--This project requires Python and several key libraries to function correctly. You can install all necessary modules using the requirements.txt file.

Key modules include:

1-streamlit

2-torch & torchvision

3-pydicom

4-opencv-python-headless

5-pandas

To install them, run the following command in your terminal:

pip install -r requirements.txt

You will also need to download the VinDr-CXR dataset from PhysioNet and place it in the appropriate data directory. -->

### How to run the script
<!--1-Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/CliniScan.git](https://github.com/your-username/CliniScan.git)
cd CliniScan

2-Install the prerequisites:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3-Run the Streamlit web application:

streamlit run app.py

4-Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501). -->
